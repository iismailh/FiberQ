FIBERQ : Open-source algorithm for automatic quantification of DNA fibers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this file, you will find a description of the software FiberQ for the 
quantification of DNA fiber length. 
This is the matlab implementation of the algorithm described in detail in the paper : 

TODO: REFERENCE OF THE PAPER

There are two ways to use FiberQ :

--> If you don't have any programming experience, you can use a free compiled version of the code availaible here (This version works only on windows) : TODO ADRESS. 

--> If you have matlab R2018a (or later), you can use the source code. You will need the following toolboxes : 
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Mearning Toolbox
- Curve Fitting Toolbox
- Computer Vision System Toolbox

1) Open Matlab and change the default directory to '\FiberQ'.
2) Click on "main_FiberQ.mlapp"
3) Click on "help" and follow the instructions
